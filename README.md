# jaML

“Ughh! I want to work on data science and machine learning, but I don’t know how to code!!” Have you ever been in such a situation? I know we have! 

Introducing our idea - **jaML**. We have seen many autoML applications where the developer/newbie can just import some modules and write one line of code to create their very own ML model. But, have you realized how tiresome it is? Install dependencies, set up the environment, import modules, and, moreover, you cannot just pass in any dataset without having any preprocessing or EDA done. Well, that’s where we come in!

We are planning to develop a full-fledged web application where the user(Basically ANYONE!) can upload the dataset and using drop-down UI/UX can just select what he wants to do with the dataset ranging from viewing the data to EDA to creating your own machine learning model, without any coding experience!! 


What’s the catch though? **NOTHING!** Moreover, we have made it **open-source** to test the extents that this application can actually go to!!

Sounds far fetched? We have a **Proof-Of-Concept** ready for the basic tasks of our web application.

Here is th4e system architecture of our application -
